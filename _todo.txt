## Features

- Stamina to run faster, runs out after a while and is regained by not running
- X-ray vision (wireframing) for players to find the bomber (has a red rectangle in his body)
- Random floating models that give a power up like extra stamina
- 1 chicken automatically becomes the bomber
- Custom chickens
- Collision between chickens
- Changes in terrain
- Pilar coming out of the ground with a lever and random event (model floating above pilar to indicate what event if you pull the lever)
- pass bomb to other chicken if you have it
- global timer of bomb, if timer = 0 it explodes
- Arena becomes smaller after a timer, if you're outside you lose (to make it more interesting)
- Bomb timer in the sky on cube in middle of arena
